# Surface-Defect-Detection

## Overview
* The project is an application of deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks for automatic surface defect detection in hot rolled metal strips.
* It aims to detect metal surface defects such as rolled-in scale, patches, crazing, pitted surface, inclusion and scratches (total 6 classes) in Hot-Rolled Steel Strips.
* The model is trained on NEU (Northeastern University) Metal Surface Defects Database which contain 1800 grayscale images with 300 samples of each of the six classes.
